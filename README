Link2App - open links in their native apps
-------------------------------------------

Tired of twitter links opening in Safari? Want dropbox to open in its app? (you actually can’t with dropbox but it’s an example). Well now you can achieve that for any app with a (documented) url scheme. Easily extensible via Lua scripts, you can open any link in its native app.

Lua file format
-------------------------------------------
must return function(url) and should return nil or the modified url
View /Library/Link2App/Scripts/twitter.lua for an example


Currently implemented
-------------------------------------------
twitter                redirect user profiles, anyway
browser changer        change http(s) link to open in google chrome. Should be simple to modify for other web browsers.



Unable to implement
-------------------------------------------
Dropbox                lack of url scheme support
Vine                   lack of url scheme documentation(/support?)
